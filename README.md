# My expenses app

This project is an attempt for me to grasp a practical understanding of AWS'S SAM framework and Textract machine learning service for text analyzation and extraction.

This is achieved by implementing a simple mobile that allows a user to take a picture of a receipt or any input expense document and have it analyzed and have the relevant data extracted and persisted. The persisted data can then be presented to the user in a specific screen for better monthly tracking of expenses.
